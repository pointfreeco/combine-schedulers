  /// A type-erasing wrapper for the `Scheduler` protocol, which can be useful for being generic over
  /// many types of schedulers without needing to actually introduce a generic to your code.
  ///
  /// This type is useful for times that you want to be able to customize the scheduler used in some
  /// code from the outside, but you don't want to introduce a generic to make it customizable. For
  /// example, suppose you have a view model `ObservableObject` that performs an API request when a
  /// method is called:
  ///
  ///     class EpisodeViewModel: ObservableObject {
  ///       @Published var episode: Episode?
  ///       private var cancellables: Set<AnyCancellable> = []
  ///
  ///       let apiClient: ApiClient
  ///
  ///       init(apiClient: ApiClient) {
  ///         self.apiClient = apiClient
  ///       }
  ///
  ///       func reloadButtonTapped() {
  ///         self.apiClient.fetchEpisode()
  ///           .receive(on: DispatchQueue.main)
  ///           .sink { self.episode = $0 }
  ///           .store(in: &self.cancellables)
  ///       }
  ///     }
  ///
  /// Notice that we are using `DispatchQueue.main` in the `reloadButtonTapped` method because the
  /// `fetchEpisode` endpoint most likely delivers its output on a background thread (as is the case
  /// with `URLSession`).
  ///
  /// This code seems innocent enough, but the presence of `.receive(on: DispatchQueue.main)` makes
  /// this code harder to test since you have to use `XCTest` expectations to explicitly wait a small
  /// amount of time for the queue to execute. This can lead to flakiness in tests and make test
  /// suites take longer to execute than necessary.
  ///
  /// One way to fix this testing problem is to use an "immediate" scheduler instead of
  /// `DispatchQueue.main`, which will cause `fetchEpisode` to deliver its output as soon as possible
  /// with no thread hops. In order to allow for this we would need to inject a scheduler into our
  /// view model so that we can control it from the outside:
  ///
  ///     class EpisodeViewModel<S: Scheduler>: ObservableObject {
  ///       @Published var episode: Episode?
  ///       private var cancellables: Set<AnyCancellable> = []
  ///
  ///       let apiClient: ApiClient
  ///       let scheduler: S
  ///
  ///       init(apiClient: ApiClient, scheduler: S) {
  ///         self.apiClient = apiClient
  ///         self.scheduler = scheduler
  ///       }
  ///
  ///       func reloadButtonTapped() {
  ///         self.apiClient.fetchEpisode()
  ///           .receive(on: self.scheduler)
  ///           .sink { self.episode = $0 }
  ///           .store(in: &self.cancellables)
  ///       }
  ///     }
  ///
  /// Now we can initialize this view model in production by using `DispatchQueue.main` and we can
  /// initialize it in tests using `DispatchQueue.immediateScheduler`. Sounds like a win!
  ///
  /// However, introducing this generic to our view model is quite heavyweight as it is loudly
  /// announcing to the outside world that this type uses a scheduler, and worse it will end up
  /// infecting any code that touches this view model that also wants to be testable. For example,
  /// any view that uses this view model will need to introduce a generic if it wants to also be able
  /// to control the scheduler, which would be useful if we wanted to write snapshot tests.
  ///
  /// Instead of introducing a generic to allow for substituting in different schedulers we can use
  /// `AnyScheduler`. It allows us to be somewhat generic in the scheduler, but without actually
  /// introducing a generic.
  ///
  /// Instead of holding a generic scheduler in our view model we can say that we only want a
  /// scheduler whose associated types match that of `DispatchQueue`:
  ///
  ///     class EpisodeViewModel: ObservableObject {
  ///       @Published var episode: Episode?
  ///
  ///       let apiClient: ApiClient
  ///       let scheduler: AnySchedulerOf<DispatchQueue>
  ///
  ///       init(apiClient: ApiClient, scheduler: AnySchedulerOf<DispatchQueue>) {
  ///         self.apiClient = apiClient
  ///         self.scheduler = scheduler
  ///       }
  ///
  ///       func reloadButtonTapped() {
  ///         self.apiClient.fetchEpisode()
  ///           .receive(on: self.scheduler)
  ///           .sink { self.episode = $0 }
  ///       }
  ///     }
  ///
  /// Then, in production we can create a view model that uses a live `DispatchQueue`, but we just
  /// have to first erase its type:
  ///
  ///     let viewModel = EpisodeViewModel(
  ///       apiClient: ...,
  ///       scheduler: DispatchQueue.main.eraseToAnyScheduler()
  ///     )
  ///
  /// And similarly in tests we can use an immediate scheduler as long as we erase its type:
  ///
  ///     let viewModel = EpisodeViewModel(
  ///       apiClient: ...,
  ///       scheduler: DispatchQueue.immediateScheduler.eraseToAnyScheduler()
  ///     )
  ///
  /// So, in general, `AnyScheduler` is great for allowing one to control what scheduler is used
  /// in classes, functions, etc. without needing to introduce a generic, which can help simplify
  /// the code and reduce implementation details from leaking out.
