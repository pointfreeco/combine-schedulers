  extension Scheduler {
    /// Specifies an animation to perform when an action is scheduled. This can be useful for times
    /// that you cannot easily wrap state mutations in a `withAnimation` block.
    ///
    /// For example, if you load some asynchronous data in an `ObservableObject` and then
    /// pipe its output into a `@Published` field, you may be tempted to use the `.assign(to:)`
    /// operator:
    ///
    ///     class ViewModel: ObservableObject {
    ///       @Published var articles: [Article] = []
    ///
    ///       init() {
    ///         apiClient.loadArticles()
    ///           .receive(on: DispatchQueue.main)
    ///           .assign(to: self.$articles)
    ///       }
    ///     }
    ///
    /// However, this prevents you from wrapping the `articles` mutation in `withAnimation` since
    /// that is hidden from you in the `.assign(to:)` operator. In this situation you can simply
    /// use the `.animation` operator on `Scheduler` to transform `DispatchQueue.main` into a
    /// scheduler that performs its work inside `withAnimation`:
    ///
    ///     class ViewModel: ObservableObject {
    ///       @Published var articles: [Article] = []
    ///
    ///       init() {
    ///         apiClient.loadArticles()
    ///           .receive(on: DispatchQueue.main.animation())
    ///           .assign(to: self.$articles)
    ///       }
    ///     }
    ///
    /// Another common use case is when you have a Combine publisher made up of many publishers
    /// that have been merged or concatenated. You may want to animate the outputs of each of
    /// those publishers differently:
    ///
    ///     class ViewModel: ObservableObject {
    ///       @Published var articles: [Article] = []
    ///
    ///       init() {
    ///         cachedArticles()
    ///           // Don't animate cached articles when they load
    ///           .receive(on: DispatchQueue.main.animation(nil))
    ///           .append(
    ///             apiClient.loadArticles()
    ///               // Animate the fresh articles when they load
    ///               .receive(on: DispatchQueue.main.animation())
    ///           )
    ///       }
